## Github projects

### MMR Estimation of players in the game DOTA 2 based on match history. (Master's Thesis)
[Repository] (https://github.com/dtoma95/dota2_mmr_estimation)

This project encompasses:
- Collecting a large database of DOTA2 player's match history and MMR
- Augmenting the collected data for different kinds of neural network training tasks.
- Training several neural network architectures including an RNN, CNNs and normal a perceptron network in order to discover the optimal architecture type for the presented task. 



### Generating images to fool trained neural networks using simple search algorithm. (Bachelor's Thesis)
[Repository] (https://github.com/dtoma95/Soft_computing_picture_generation)

Exploring ways to perform adverserial attacks using bruteforce-like methods on neural networks trained for classification tasks.



### Converting Legal documents of the Republic of Serbia to the Akoma Ntoso standard
[Repository] (https://github.com/dtoma95/converting_rs_legal_acts_to_akoma_ntoso)

This project collects legal documents written in plaintext or simple html formats and converts them to the Akom Ntoso standardized xml format for legal documents.

The input documents are collected from the official [website](http://www.pravno-informacioni-sistem.rs/SlGlasnikPortal/fp/news) of the government of the Republic of Serbia.
